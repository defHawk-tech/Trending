# Comprehensive Report on Security Vulnerabilities in JavaScript Serialization Libraries

## Overview
This document details the recently disclosed vulnerabilities in popular JavaScript serialization libraries, including `serialize-javascript`, `serialize-to-js`, and `node-serialize`. These vulnerabilities allow for the exploitation of Remote Code Execution (RCE) by attackers, posing significant security risks to applications relying on these libraries.

### Libraries Covered:
1. **serialize-javascript**
2. **serialize-to-js**
3. **node-serialize**

## Vulnerability Details

### 1. Vulnerability in `serialize-javascript` (CVE-2020-7660)

**Introduced**: Disclosed on May 20, 2020  
**Severity**: CVSS Score 8.1 (Important to Critical)  

#### Description
A security flaw in the `serialize-javascript` NPM package allows attackers to exploit insecure serialization and perform remote code execution (RCE). This vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2020-7660, exists in versions below 3.1.0 of the library and can be triggered through the `deleteFunctions` function within `index.js`.

#### Technical Details
- An insecure serialization issue enables user input to manipulate serialized objects, bypassing safeguards.
- Attackers can inject arbitrary code by controlling key values and guessing a UID, which has a keyspace of approximately four billion, making the attack realistic.

#### Proof of Concept
Example exploitation:
```javascript
eval('('+ serialize({"foo": /1" + console.log(1)/i, "bar": '"@__R-<UID>-0__@'}) + ')');
```

The vulnerability was patched in version 3.1.0 through changes ensuring placeholders are not preceded by a backslash and by incorporating a higher entropy UID.

#### Impact
- The library has over 16 million downloads and 840 dependent projects, leading to wide-reaching implications.
- Affected repositories include Ruby on Railsâ€™ Webpacker.

#### Mitigation
Upgrade to `serialize-javascript` version **3.1.0 or higher**.

### 2. Vulnerability in `serialize-to-js` (CVE-2017-5954)

**Introduced**: February 9, 2017  
**Severity**: CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data)  

#### Description
The `serialize-to-js` library is vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution when untrusted user input is passed into its `deserialize()` method. This issue is exploited by sending a serialized JavaScript Object containing an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE).

#### Technical Details
- Attackers can craft payloads that invoke malicious code during deserialization.

#### Proof of Concept
Example payload:
```javascript
var serialize = require('serialize-to-js');
var payload = '{"rce":"_$$ND_FUNC$$_function (){require(\'child_process\').exec(\'ls /\', function(error, stdout, stderr) { console.log(stdout) });}()"}';
serialize.deserialize(payload);
```

#### Mitigation
Upgrade to `serialize-to-js` version **1.0.0 or higher**.

---

### 3. Vulnerability in `node-serialize` (CVE-2017-5941)

**Introduced**: February 2017  
**Severity**: CWE-502 (Deserialization of Untrusted Data)  

#### Description
The `node-serialize` library is vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution when deserializing untrusted user input. This issue arises because the library allows the execution of JavaScript code embedded in serialized objects.

#### Technical Details
- An attacker can include a malicious JavaScript payload in serialized data that gets executed during deserialization.

#### Proof of Concept
Example payload:
```javascript
var serialize = require('node-serialize');
var payload = '{"rce":"_$$ND_FUNC$$_function (){require(\'child_process\').exec(\'ls /\', function(error, stdout, stderr) { console.log(stdout) });}()"}';
serialize.unserialize(payload);
```

#### Mitigation
The library is no longer maintained. Avoid using `node-serialize` and replace it with secure alternatives such as `safe-serialize` or `secure-json-serialize`.

## Summary of Fixes
| Library                | CVE ID         | Severity      | Affected Versions    | Fixed Version      |
|------------------------|----------------|---------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| `serialize-javascript` | CVE-2020-7660  | Important      | < 3.1.0             | >= 3.1.0          |
| `serialize-to-js`      | CVE-2017-5954  | Moderate       | < 1.0.0             | >= 1.0.0          |
| `node-serialize`       | CVE-2017-5941  | High           | All versions         | Not maintained     |

---

## Recommendations
1. **Immediate Action**: Update affected libraries to their latest patched versions or replace deprecated libraries with secure alternatives.
2. **Secure Development Practices**: Avoid deserializing untrusted user inputs directly. Validate and sanitize all inputs.
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Regularly review security advisories for dependencies in use.

By following these steps, developers can mitigate the risks associated with these vulnerabilities and safeguard their applications against potential exploitation.
